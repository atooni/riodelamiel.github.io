Yoga in it simple yet deep wisdom always fascinated her. The balance of breath and pose within the asanas,
the nature of the mind in resonance with its environment and the vedantic philosophy for her three sides of
a unifying truth.

The desire to live and teach a holistic approach to Yoga lead her and her husband Ramdas to the coast of Andalucia
