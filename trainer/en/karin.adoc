http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/swami-sivananda.html[Swami Sivananda]. Since her graduation she teaches Yoga
with great empathy in her own studios und with Yoga organizations worldwide.

Continously she visited Ashrams in Europe and India for further studies. She is a Yoga Archyara also in the tradition of
http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/swami-sivananda.html[Swami Sivananda] and has attended a Yoga Therapy course by
Harilal Ji.

Atmayjothi teaches Yoga with great passion. She encourages her students to pursue the search for their potential
within and to live it to the fullest joy.

Yoga in its simple yet deep wisdom always fascinated her. The balance of breath and pose within the asanas,
the nature of the mind in resonance with its environment and the vedantic philosophy for her are three sides of
a unifying truth.

The desire to live and teach a holistic approach to Yoga led her and her husband Ramdas to the coast of Andalusia
where they have created the seminar house _Rio de la Miel_. Here they offer Yoga vacations and courses for Yoga
beginners and experienced practitioners.
