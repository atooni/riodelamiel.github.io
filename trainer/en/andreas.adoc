Ramdas has joined his wife in her Yoga practice and practices himself for some years. He is also a yoga teacher in the
tradition of http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/swami-sivananda.html[Swami Sivananda]. Even while he still worked as an
IT consultant he has taught Yoga whenever his time allowed it. In _Rio de la Miel_ he teaches Yoga for beginners and meditation.

In his job he has noticed again and again the positive effects of simple Yoga and meditation techniques facing
the day-to-day job challenges: Whether it is _just_ a more relaxed state of mind in the face of the daily
challenges or finally the need to acknowledge and respect everyone met in business life as an equal human being -
Yoga teaches how this can be achieved and is today more important than ever.

Besides the well-known benefits Yoga can also help learning new skills with simple Yoga and meditation exercises.
From these experiences he has developed a course concept combining a daily Yoga practice, a healthy diet and learning
into a holistic learning experience.

Over time _Rio de la Miel_ will offer a variety of courses with external trainers so that the students can
experience the positive effects of Yoga on learning all by themselves.
