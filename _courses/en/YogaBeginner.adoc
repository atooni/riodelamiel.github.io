Even as the number of fitness programs and styles grows - people's interest for Yoga remains strong as it already
was for thousands of years. The secret behind the success of Yoga is that Yoga is not restricted to the mere
mechanical aspects but offers a holistic experience for all practitioners. At the end for the Yogi the body is
one of many vessels for the soul on its journey to perfection.

In our beginners' course we provide a glimpse into the holistic experience Yoga can provide and we teach our students
their first asanas. We always encourage our students to probe for their own limitations and more importantly
understand them as challenges rather than restrictions.

With that mindset even a Yoga beginner can greatly benefit from a daily Yoga routine and grow as his practice deepens.

The surroundings of _Rio de la Miel_, the vegan kitchen and the daily schedule with meditation, yoga and kirtans
provide a complete yoga experience for all audiences.
