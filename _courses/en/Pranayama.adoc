Prana, the life energy, surrounds us and can be found in every being. We absorb it with our food and we can feel it
in its purest form in places close to nature, such as _Rio de la Miel_. The knowledge about prana and how to control 
it is called _Pranayama_. 

In its most subtle form prana manifests itself in our minds through the thoughts we have. We can easily observe ourselves
that breathing and thoughts are tightly coupled. We just need to hold our breath for a little while or excalerate our
breathing for a bit and we will see that the speed of our thoughts align with our breathing very quickly.

In Yoga we use pranayama to control our thoughts by learning to control our breathing. Once we master pranayama it
opens a sheer unlimited well of energy. We can leverage that energy not only in our 10-day course, but we will learn
how to tap into that energy in our daily practice.

Here in _Rio de la Miel_, protected by the mountains and with a view across the mediterranean sea, can we leverage the
ideal location to learn and practice the techniques of pranayama.

The course has a duration of 10 days so that we can slowly increase the intensity our exercises and also have some time
to decrease the intensity at the end.

We strongly advise the participants of this course to participate in all our meditations and Yoga classes during the course
and also exclusively have their meals in _Rio de la Miel_ throughout the course. If you want to explore Nerja and its
surroundings it is better to plan for a few extra days around the course.
