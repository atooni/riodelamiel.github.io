Meditation is the key to positive thinking, inner peace, creativity and joy in life. Everyone can learn meditation,
given some basic patience. Already 10-15 minutes of daily practice can tap into an inexhaustable energy supply of
energy and provide inner peace and balance. In a meditative state we can connect to our higher self. In our meditation
course we want to show and share these experiences.

After covering the basic theory of meditation we will take a look at various meditation techniques and learn how to
apply those in a daily practice. Our special focus is on those techniques that are simple to apply, so that our
guests can continue their practice at home.

Always remember doing a little meditation a day is better than doing it occasionally and longer.
