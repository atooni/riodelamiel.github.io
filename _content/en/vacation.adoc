== The seminar house _Rio de la Miel_

The seminar house _Rio de la Miel_ is located right at the edge of the nature park _Sierra Tejada_ close to the village
of Nerja in the province of Malaga, Andalucia. _Rio de la Miel_ is exclusively for Yoga seminars and offers Yoga
guests a holistic experience with daily 2 meditations, 2 Yoga classes and 2 vegan meals (brunch and diner).

Throughout the stay our guests can benefit from the unique silence in the andalucian mountains and disconnect from
the normal day-to-day stress. At the same time we are close to the coast and the beautiful village of Nerja for occasional
excursions. In _Rio de la Miel_ we omit alcohol, cigarettes and any animal products. Located at the edge of a nature park
we don't have mobile connectivity though all our guests may use our internet connection in the reception area for free.
Having only a satellite connection, the connectivity is restricted to eMails, simple web browsing and text based
messaging services.

Yoga vacations in _Rio de la Miel_ can be booked at any time and for any duration. All vacation guests may participate
in our meditations and Yoga classes. Participation is not mandatory but a joined Yoga practice helps us build up the
energy in our seminar house. We are happy to introduce Yoga beginners to a daily practice.

=== Karma Yoga

For people interested in a longer term Yoga practice we offer food, shelter, Yoga and meditation in exchange
for helping us in _Rio de la Miel_. The actual work depends on the need at hands and the Karma Yogis capabilities.
Throughout the stay we expect 4-5 hours or work per day.

Throughout the year we primarily need help running the seminar house, cleaning and within the kitchen. In quieter
times we are planning to extend the facilities at _Rio de la Miel_.
