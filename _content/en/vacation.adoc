== The seminar house _Rio de la Miel_

The seminar house _Rio de la Miel_ is located right at the edge of the nature park _Sierra Tejada_ close to the village
of Nerja in the province of Malaga, Andalusia. _Rio de la Miel_ is exclusively for Yoga seminars and offers Yoga
guests a holistic experience with daily 2 meditations, 2 Yoga classes and 2 vegan meals (brunch and diner).

Throughout the stay our guests can benefit from the unique silence in the Andalusian mountains and disconnect from
the normal day-to-day stress. At the same time we are close to the coast and the beautiful village of Nerja for occasional
excursions. In _Rio de la Miel_ we omit alcohol, cigarettes and any animal products. Located at the edge of a nature park
we don't have mobile connectivity, all our guests may use our internet connection in the reception area for free.
Having only a satellite connection, the connectivity is restricted to emails, simple web browsing and text based
messaging services.

Yoga vacations in _Rio de la Miel_ can be booked at any time and for any duration. All vacation guests may participate
in our meditation and Yoga classes. Participation is not mandatory but a joined Yoga practice helps us to build up the
energy in our seminar house. We are happy to introduce Yoga beginners to a daily practice.

=== Karma Yoga

For people interested in a longer term Yoga practice we offer food, shelter, Yoga and meditation in exchange
for helping us in _Rio de la Miel_. The actual work depends on the need at hands and the Karma Yogis' capabilities.
Throughout the stay we expect 4h-5h of work per day.

Throughout the year we primarily need help running the seminar house, cleaning and within the kitchen. In quieter
times we are planning to extend the facilities at _Rio de la Miel_.
