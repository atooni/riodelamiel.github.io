Atmayjothi practices Yoga for many years and is a yoga teacher in the tradition of
http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/swami-sivananda.html[Swami Sivananda]. Since her graduation she teaches Yoga
with great empathy in her own studios und with Yoga organisations world wide.

Continously she visited Ashrams in Europe and India for further studies. She is a Yoga Archyara also in the tradition of
http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/swami-sivananda.html[Swami Sivananda] and has attended a Yoga Therapy course by
Harilal Ji.

Atmayjothi teaches Yoga with great passion. She encourages her students to pursue the search for their potential
within and live it to the fullest joy.

Yoga in its simple yet deep wisdom always fascinated her. The balance of breath and pose within the asanas,
the nature of the mind in resonance with its environment and the vedantic philosophy for her are three sides of
a unifying truth.

The desire to live and teach a holistic approach to Yoga lead her and her husband Ramdas to the coast of Andalucia
where they have created the seminar house _Rio de la Miel_. Here they offer Yoga vacations and courses for Yoga
beginners and experienced practitioners.

Ramdas has joined his wife in her Yoga practice and practices himself for some years. He is also a yoga teacher in the
tradition of http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/swami-sivananda.html[Swami Sivananda]. Even while he still worked as an
IT consultant he has taught Yoga whenever his time allowed. In _Rio de la Miel_ he teaches Yoga for beginners and meditation.

In his job he has noticed again and again the positive effects of simple Yoga and meditation techniques facing
the day-to-day job challenges. Whether it is _just_ a more relaxed state of mind in the face of the daily
challenges or finally the need to acknowledge and respect everyone met in business life as an equal human being -
Yoga teaches how this can be achieved and is today more important than ever.

Besides the well-known benefits Yoga can also help learning new skills with simple Yoga- and meditation exercises.
From these experiences he has developed a course concept combining a daily Yoga practice, a healthy diet and learning
into a holistic learning experience.

Over time _Rio de la Miel_ will offer a variety of courses with external trainers so that the stufents can
experience the positive effects of Yoga on learning all by themselves.
