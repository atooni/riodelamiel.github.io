Yoga vactions close to the beautiful nature park Sierra Tejada allows us to experience a
deep relaxation for the body, the mind and the soul. Remoting ourselves from modern
communication leads us back to balance and peace in the mind.

Meditation, Pranayama, healthy food and  Asanas under the andalusian sun let us get back in contact with
our inner peace and strength. A daily Yoga practice teaches us how Yoga can enrich our daily life.

Our guests will find exactly that combination in our seminar house close to the andalusian coast in the
vicinity of Nerja in the province of Malaga. In our daily Yoga routine we offer a fixed daily schedule
with 2 meditations, 2 Yoga classes, 2 vegan meals and sufficient free time to explore the nature around
the seminar house and the beautiful landscapes of Andalucia.

The experience of meditation is hard to describe and one has to experience it personally. The deeper the
meditation the less important becomes the meaning of space and time. The daily routine also becomes less
important and the mind can focus on the bliss of the present moment.

A vegan diet consequently applies the Yoga principle of Ahimsa - the renunciation of violence. On top a vegan diet
also makes sense to maintain your personal health and energy. Around _Rio de la Miel_ we find all the local
products we need to provide a rich and healthy vegan diet for our guests.

Our Yogaclasses are based on 12 basic postures (Asanas) that can be found in Hathayoga. Breathing exercises (Pranayama),
meditation and relaxation help us to find the right balance in our Yoga practice. The exercises are beneficial for
Yogabeginners but also have challenges for more experienced Yoga practitioners.
