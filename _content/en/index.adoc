== Rio de la Miel

In only a few weeks we will leave our house in Salobre√±a and move in at _Rio de la Miel_. Some helpers are already
preparing their travel to Andalucia and will arrive at the end of the month.

All who have already connected with us on https://www.facebook.com/riodelamiel[Facebook] might find some additional -
and hopefully useful - information here on our web site.

_Please be patient, we are just creating the content for the web site and in November we will have help to make it
beautiful. Until then we will start by adding the dates for the first courses in 2016._

For now remember aur facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/riodelamiel and the associated facebook group
https://www.facebook.com/groups/1037207009623135/

We are looking forward to meet you at _Rio de la Miel_ soon

Karin & Andreas
