Karin Gies (Atmay Joti) practices Yoga for many years and participated in 2005 in a Yoga Teacher's Training in the
 tradition of 
http://www.sivananda.org[Swami Sivananda]. 
(More about Swami Sivananda: https://www.google.es/search?sa=G&q=swami+sivananda+Quotes&ved=0ahUKEwi-76bPrKnJAhUG5iYKHTJRBJUQh1sIpQEwGw, or have a look
at this yoga style here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwCZyq7emDc)
But it's more than simply yoga, here's the philosophy of Swami Sivananda:

FIVE POINTS OF YOGA
Proper Exercise (Asanas) - Yoga poses help develop a strong, healthy body by enhancing flexibility and improving circulation.
Proper Breathing (Pranayama) - Deep, conscious breathing reduces stress and many diseases.
Proper Relaxation - Helps keep the body from going into overload mode, easing worry and fatigue.
Proper Diet - Eating simple, healthy and vegetarian foods that are easy to digest notably have a positive effect on the mind and body, as well as the 
environment and other living beings.
Positive Thinking (Vedanta) and Meditation (Dhyana) - These are the true keys to achieving peace of mind and eliminating negativity in our lives.


Ever since, she teaches Yoga with great empathy at her own yoga
studio or as a guest teacher in Yoga locations all over the world.

In 2006, she completed a uplevelling training as yoga archyara, also in the tradition of Swami Sivananda.
2009 was a further training as yoga therapist at Harilalji.



Yoga in its simple but so profound wisdom always fascinated Karin.
In her opinion, the interaction of breathing and movement in the asanas; the nature of mind in harmony with our environment and the vedantic philosophy 
combine themselves to create a meaningful Oneness.

Karin Gies teaches filled with passion and dedication.

She encourages her students in theirs pursuit, to fully discover and experience their own potential.

2014, she has decided to focus now on holistic yoga and to organize and conduct yoga retreats and lessons in alignment with her husband Andreas here in 
this lovely area of Rio de la Miel.

Andreas Gies became infected by the enthusiasm of his wife and also practices yoga since several years.
In 2006, he completed his yoga teacher education as well as his wife in the tradition of Swami Sivananda and teaches since then, whenever his time
allowes it.

After studying computer science, he has more than 20 years working experience in international projects as consultant and in 2010, he founded the "Way of Quality GmbH"
that cares primarily about quality-oriented software development and use of open source technologies in large projects.

In this function as an IT consultant, he has noted ever and ever again, how simple yoga practices can bring an immense improvement in professional life.
Especially when it comes to learn new technologies, a regular yoga practice has proven to be enourmous beneficial.


Inspired from these experiences, he has developed a course concept that contains a daily yoga practice, a balanced diet and learning new technologies.

These unique, combined IT / yoga classes will be part of the course program in summer 2016 in Rio de la Miel.

Universal teachings  of Swami Sivananda:
UNIVERSAL RELIGIOUS TEACHINGS

The essentials of all religions are the same:

Serve, love, give, purify, meditate, realise;

Be good, do good, be kind, be compassionate;

Enquire 'who am I' know the Self and be free.

Love all, serve all, serve the Lord in all.

Speak the truth, be pure, be humble,

Concentrate, meditate, attain Self-realisation.

These are the essentials of all religions.

Customs, conventions, ceremonies are non-essentials.

Do not fight over petty non-essentials.

Be tolerant, be catholic, have a broad outlook.

Respect all Prophets, all Saints, all Messengers.

All Saints speak the same language.

Here is my little song of the Yoga of Synthesis, for your daily practice:

Eat a little, drink a little,

Talk a little, sleep a little,

Mix a little, move a little,

Serve a little, rest a little

Work a little, relax a little,

Study a little, worship a little,

Do Asanas a little, Pranayamas a little,

Reflect a little, Meditate a little,

Do Japa a little, do Kirtan a little,

Write Mantra a little, have Satsanga a little.

Serve, Love, Give, Purify, Meditate, Realize.

Be Good, Do good; Be kind, Be compassionate.

Enquire 'Who am I?' Know the Self and be Free.

Asana is one of the eight limbs of classical Yoga, which states that poses should be steady and comfortable, firm yet relaxed helping a practitioner to become more aware of their body, mind, and environment.

The 12 basic poses or asanas are much more than just stretching. They open the energy channels, chakras and psychic centers of the body while increasing flexibility of the spine, strengthening bones and stimulating the circulatory and immune systems. Along with proper breathing or pranayama, asanas also calm the mind and reduce stress. With regular practice one can ensure overall physical and mental health and the possible prevention of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and arthritis. In time, performing the poses slowly and consciously, becomes a mental exercise in concentration and meditation.
